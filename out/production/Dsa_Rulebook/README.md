## 🚀 What’s This All About?

This isn’t just another dump of LeetCode problems. It’s a curated, battle-tested guide to thinking like a problem solver.  
Each rulebook entry is designed to help you crack the *why*, not just the *how*.

Here’s what you’ll find:
- 🔍 **Problem Statement** — no fluff, just the core challenge
- 🧠 **Intuition First** — how to approach it like a strategist
- 📜 **Pseudocode** — before you touch the keyboard
- 👨‍💻 **Java Code** — clean, readable, and interview-ready
- 🧪 **Edge Cases** — because bugs love the weird stuff
- 🧵 **Personal Notes** — what tripped me up, what clicked

## ✍️ Why This Exists

Because DSA shouldn’t feel like memorizing formulas. It should feel like solving puzzles with clarity and confidence.  
This rulebook is built from real prep sessions, mock interviews, and those “aha!” moments that make it all worth it.

If you:
- Think in patterns, not just syntax
- Want to write code that *feels* right
- Love seeing the “why” behind the “how”

Then you’ll feel right at home here.
